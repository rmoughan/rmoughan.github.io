Hi, I'm Ryan! I'm currently a Machine Learning Researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Lab.
Prior to that, I earned my M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
under the mentorship of Prof. Olshausen as a part of the 5th Year Master's
program at the University of California, Berkeley. I also earned my B.A. at
Berkeley with a double major in Computer Science and Statistics.

It was my privilege to be a member of two fantastic communities while at Berkeley. The first
was the teaching community in the EECS department and the second was as a researcher
at the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience. For more details about my
teaching or research history, check out those respective pages.

In my free time I like to do many of the stereotypical grad student hobbies:
run, hike, boulder, and in general anything that involves being active or
exploring the outdoors. I'm also an avid Boston sports fan, a casual Magic the
Gathering player, and a big foodie.
