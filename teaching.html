<p> I've had the opportunity to lecture in both the EECS and Neuroscience
departments at Berkeley. In the EECS department, I started as a volunteer tutor
and fell in love with teaching. From there I joined the course staff as a TA for
CS 61a, the first CS class required for the major. After a few semesters of being
a TA, I was promoted to Head TA and designed a project that has been assigned to
~10,000 students and counting. My teaching career at Berkeley culminted with
being hired as one of the instructors and lecturers for the class. The photo
above is from the lecture hall in Dwinelle where the lectures were supposed to
take place, but unfortunately the pandemic got in the way. Since graduating I've
also been invited back to give a guest lecture on hyperdimensional computing for a
graduate neuroscience class. If you want to see the classes that I have given
lectures for, check this

class and this

out for the neuroscience class. </p>

<p> I'm currently taking a small break from teaching as I transition from primarily
being a student to primarily being a researcher. However I'm always looking for
ways to stay involved in the teaching community, so feel free to reach out to me
if you think there's any ways I could help! </p>
