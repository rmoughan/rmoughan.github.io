Welcome to my blog! It's in its early stages and I hope to have some posts up
soon. The topics range from more serious research interests that I indicate [here](/research.html)
to more casual ones that revolve around my love of statistics as it applies to sports
and other hobbies. I also include a bit about my experiences in the field as both a student
and a teacher for anyone else who got started by reading blogs like these.
Feel free to reach out to me if anything ever piques your interest!
