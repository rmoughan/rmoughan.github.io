I've had the amazing opportunity to lecture in both the EECS and Neuroscience
departments at Berkeley. In the EECS department, I started as a volunteer tutor
and fell in love with teaching. From there I joined the course staff as a TA for
CS 61a, the first CS class required for the major. After a few semesters of being
a TA, I was promoted to Head TA and designed a project that has been assigned to
~20,000 students and counting. My teaching career at Berkeley culminated with
being hired as one of the lecturers for that class. The photo above is from the
lecture hall in Dwinelle where I was supposed to lecture, but unfortunately
the pandemic got in the way. Since graduating I've also been invited back to
give a guest lecture on hyperdimensional computing for a graduate neuroscience
class. If you want to see the classes that I have given lectures for, check this
[link](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/su20/) out for the CS class and
this [link](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/courses/computing-with-high-dimensional-vectors/)
out for the neuroscience class (depending on the date they may or may not be
behind authentication walls).

I'm currently taking a break from teaching as I transition from primarily
being a student to primarily being a researcher. However I'm always looking for
ways to stay involved in the teaching community, so feel free to reach out
if you think there's any way I could help!
