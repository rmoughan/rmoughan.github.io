<p> <i> Broadly speaking, I am interested in the intersection of computer science and
neuroscience. </i> </p>

<span class="underline-text"> Research interests</span>: Theoretical Neuroscience, Brain-Machine Interfaces,
Hyperdimensional Computing, Reinforcement Learning, Neuromorphic Computing, ML in Education, Explainable AI

</div>

<p> My interest in a more academic career path began after taking a neuroscience and discrete
math class in high school. In the neuroscience class I was introduced to the idea of
Brain-Machine Interfaces and read a brilliant book by Miguel Nicolelis called
<i>Beyond Boundaries</i>. That summer I worked with my friend to build my first
BMI (without any prior EE knowledge), which is the simple EEG-based device shown above. </p>

<p> As an undergraduate, I did my research at the Redwood Center for Theoretical
Neuroscience. I mainly worked on two projects during my time there. The first involved
assisting with computational modeling for the Yartsev lab. This focused on
experimenting with different supervised learning methods to distinguish bat
vocalizations from noise, as well as exploring unsupervised methods to understand
structure in the vocalizations. The second project centered around hierarchical
reinforcement learning and transfer learning for graph-based representations of
MuJoCo environments. </p>

<p> I performed my graduate research under the supervision of Prof. Olshausen, who
is the director of the Redwood Center for Theoretical Neuroscience. During my
time as a graduate student I explored deep hierarchical reinforcement learning in the
state-space domain with an interest in any relationships to hippocampal replay
events and Michael Arbib's World Graph theory. I also investigated the capabilties
of hyperdimensional computing in the context of natural language processing with
a particular focus on its capabilities when used in parallel architectures and
its performance relative to similar models. </p>

<p> Currently I do a broad range of research at Lawrence Livermore
National Lab that focuses on applied machine learning in a variety of different
fields, however unfortunately the research is generally not public. In the future
I'm looking to be more involved with the projects there that focus on neuromorpic
computing and brain-machine interfaces. In my free time I'm pursuing my research
interests noted above. Most recently that's involved working my way through a list
of research papers that I was recommended as a grad student but didn't have time
to read, some of which will be featured in my <a href="/blog/index.html">blog</a>.
